# Speech

I do most of the interactions with my smart home using my voice. This page describes my voice control setup.

## Home Speakers

None of the existing smart speakers supports the Ukrainian language (my native and primary language). I used English (US) for my devices.

I have two Google smart speakers. I've decided to go with Google because Google Assistant is smart enough and well-integrated with different accessories.

We use these speakers all the time, mostly asking to turn devices, activate scenes, start or stop vacuum, set timers or reminders. Besides, lack of Ukrainian language support, I'm pretty happy with these speakers. Sometimes I need to repeat my command twice for the speaker to pick up, but I consider it acceptable.

    I got this one as a gift for New Year 2020.

## Text to Speech

I wanted to receive voice announcements for my smart home in Ukrainian. Fortunately, [Google Translate TTS](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/google_translate/) supports voice generation for the Ukrainian language.

```yaml
tts:
  - platform: google_translate
    service_name: google_say
    language: uk # Ukrainian
```

This will generate phrases and send them to any speaker to play.

### Announcements

I built a nice announcements script for myself. I use it like this:

```yaml
service: script.announcement
data:
  # Speak on smart speakers
  speak: true
  # Send notifications on devices
  notify: true
  # Title for notification
  title: '–ú–∏—Ç—Ç—è –∞–≤—Ç–æ üöò‚òÄÔ∏è'
  # Opening phrases
  openings:
    - '–ù–∞–π–±–ª–∏–∂—á–∏–º–∏ –¥–Ω—è–º–∏ –æ—á—ñ–∫—É—î—Ç—å—Å—è —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–∞ –ø–æ–≥–æ–¥–∞.'
    - '–•–æ—Ä–æ—à–∞ –ø–æ–≥–æ–¥–∞ –Ω–∞–π–±–ª–∏–∂—á—ñ 7 –¥–Ω—ñ–≤.'
    - '–ü—Ä–æ–≥–Ω–æ–∑—É—î—Ç—å—Å—è —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–∞ –ø–æ–≥–æ–¥–∞!'
  # Main phrases
  messages:
    - '–î–æ—Ä–µ—á–Ω–æ –ø–æ–º–∏—Ç–∏ –º–∞—à–∏–Ω—É.'
    - '–í–∞—Ä—Ç–æ –ø–æ—ó—Ö–∞—Ç–∏ –Ω–∞ –∞–≤—Ç–æ–º–∏–π–∫—É.'
    - '–í–¥–∞–ª–∏–π —á–∞—Å, —â–æ–± –ø–æ–º–∏—Ç–∏ –∞–≤—Ç–æ.'
  # Additional data for notifications
  # Categories or page to open on notification opening
  notify_data:
    url: /lovelace/car
```

This script will generate a unique announcement using random phrases from `greetings` and `messages`.

The generated phrase will be spoken on smart speakers and sent as a notification to the phones. I can avoid speaking or notifying via `speak` and `notify` flags accordingly.

`notify_data` helps to pass notification categories for actionable notifications or `url` to open when I click on this notification.

## Do Not Disturb Flow

It would be annoying to get a speech announcement in the middle of the night or a working meeting. That's why I built **Do Not Disturb** mode.

**Do Not Disturb** is just automation that:

- Sets the volume of smarts speakers
- Turns on/off silence modes for fans
- Turns on/off led indicators
- Stops/starts voice announcements

‚Ä¶ based on the current time of day (sleeping or activity time) and a switch, I can toggle whenever I want.
