# War Safety

In 2022 [russia launched full-scale invasion of Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War) and wages a genocidal war against my country. Ukraine is being hit by all types of weapons (except only nuclear) on daily basis. Home Assistant helps me stay safe and notifies my about incoming threats.

We hear the siren a few times a day. The life would completely stop if we would go to the shelter every time the siren goes off. So people adapt.

In Ukraine we tend to differentiate the levels of danger. When siren goes off, practically all of the people start checking their phones: "What is going on?"

We have [various applications](https://alerts.in.ua/) and [Telegram channels](https://t.me/s/war_monitor) for monitoring the type of danger, missiles path and understand whether you are in a direct danger or you can live another minute.

This is how war in 21st century looks like: you can practically monitor a missile or a drone that is trying to kill you right from you phone. This is like a Black Mirror episode in a real life üòÖ

There are different kinds of air alarms, with different level of danger:

- **MiG-31K take off** ‚Äì this can happen multiple times during the day. [MiG-31K](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan_MiG-31) can carry a very dangerous [Kh-47M2 Kinzhal hypersonic missile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kh-47M2_Kinzhal). It happens rarely, but you can't predict when the missile is attached and when not, so most of the people tolerate this level of danger.
- **Suicide drones attack** - usually carried out by [iranian Shahed 136 drones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HESA_Shahed_136). Most of them get shot down, but it's a dangerous thing. Scary as fuck. We call them "mopeds" or "lawn-mower" by the sound of their engine.
- **Ballistic missile attack** ‚Äì¬†this can happen multiple times a day. Ballistic missiles (like [9K720 Iskander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/9K720_Iskander)) are extremely fast (2km/s). You have only up to 10 minutes to hide somewhere. Usually the fastest way is to hide behind two walls (corridor or a bathroom).
- **Cruise missile attack.** - cruise missile (like [Kalibr](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalibr_(missile_family)>)) are relatively slow and fly like a plane. Nevertheless, they can fly a long distance and easily reach out any point in the country.

Of course, the most danger type of attack is a combined ones. This means all from the above is raining down on Ukrainian cities simultainiasly. They usually happen overnight at 4:00 in the morning.
The drones and cruise missiles are used to exhaust air defenses, followed by ballistic and/or hypersonic strikes.

# Monitoring Air Alerts

Home Assistant has a built in [Ukraine Alarm](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/ukraine_alarm/) integration. It monitors nation-wide system of air alarms and toggles safety sensors in HA.

When there is any type of danger, I send a critical notification and announce the message on my smart speakers.

Of course, the air siren goes off on the streets roaring across the city, so everyone hears the danger is approaching. But I made an automation to send a critical notification and speak at home speakers, so I certainly wake up to check what is going on.

```yaml
id: air_siren_kyiv
alias: 'Alert: Air Siren in Kyiv'
description:
  Air Alert announcement when we are in Kyiv. Sends critical notifications
  and announces on speakers.
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.alerts_kyiv_air
    to: 'on'
    from: 'off'
    variables:
      title: Air Alert goes off!
  - platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.alerts_kyiv_air
    to: 'off'
    from: 'on'
    variables:
      title: It is safe now!
condition:
  - alias: Someone is in Kyiv
    condition: state
    entity_id: sensor.family_in_kyiv
    state: 'on'
action:
  - service: script.announcement
    data:
      title: '{{ title }}'
      force_speak: true # Speaks even in DND mode
      notify_data:
        group: air-alerts
        push:
          sound:
            name: default
            critical: 1
            volume: 0.75
```

# Scraping monitoring channels

I already mentioned we have various Telegram channels for monitoring the situation during an attack. Those channels provide live updates on dangers, flight paths, type of attack.

So often I used to find myself constantly checking my phone to understand whether I am in direct danger or can sleep for a few hours. _I know it sounds crazy and normal people would go straight to the nearby shelter, but this is the life in Ukraine. You don't have to follow my reckless example, if you are in Ukraine GO TO THE SHELTER!_

I decided to automate it. Instead of reading these channels by myself, I delegate this task to HA.

I use [HA Multiscrape](https://github.com/danieldotnl/ha-multiscrape) custom integration for that. You may as "why do you need a custom component, when [HA has a built-in scraping component](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/scrape/)?". Yes, it has, but I need multiple sensors from a single scrape and I need to work with lists of data. The built-in component has some limitations with that.

## Monitoring Imminent Danger

Cruise missiles are usually carried and launched by [Tu-95 bombers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tupolev_Tu-95).

They fly to the missile launch sites for about 3 hours, launch their missiles, then it take about 1-2 hours for missiles to fly to Kyiv. So there's some time to prepare a hideout (in my case it's bathroom), gather the documents and sleep for a few hours before the "show" begins.

Usually it happens in the evening and means tonight will be a massive missile attack.

I have a sensor that checks the Telegram channels, it scrapes the list of messages every 5 seconds, check if the latest message contains specific set of words, like _"take off" **and** "plane" **and** "tu-95"_. It also stores the latest message as an attribute.

```yaml
multiscrape:
  - name: War Monitor
    resource: https://t.me/s/war_monitor
    scan_interval: 5
    list_separator: '|||'
    binary_sensor:
      - unique_id: imminent_attack_in_war_monitor
        name: Imminent Attack in War Monitor
        icon: mdi:airplane-clock
        device_class: safety
        select_list: '.js-message_text'
        value_template: >-
          {% set message = value.split("|||") | last | lower %}
          {{ "–∑–ª—ñ—Ç" in message and "–±–æ—Ä—Ç—ñ–≤" in message and "—Ç—É-95" in message }}
        attributes:
          - name: latest_message
            select_list: '.js-message_text'
            value_template: "{{ value.split('|||') | last }}"
```

So when the sensor turns on, it means the bombers are airborne and it's time to get ready, the notification is sent:

```yaml
alias: 'Alert: Imminent Attack by Strategic Bombers'
description:
  Send a notification when Tu-95 strategic bombers take off from Russian
  airfields. This means attack by cruise missiles is imminent. Prepare a hideout.
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id:
      - binary_sensor.imminent_attack_in_war_monitor
      - binary_sensor.imminent_attack_in_operinform
    from: 'off'
    to: 'on'
action:
  - service: script.announcement
    data:
      service: notify.all
      speak: false
      notify: true
      title: 'Bombers take off üõ´'
      messages:
        - '{{ trigger.to_state.attributes.latest_message }}'
```

## Direct Danger Alert

This is the most interesting sensor, which notifies my right when there's a direct threat in my location.

When attack happens at night you need to decide:

- Are you going to the shelter to get a sleepless night somewhere in a basement or in the subway?
- Or are you going to stay in bed as long as possible to have a least some sleep, because you need to go to work tomorrow?

Every normal person would go to the shelter. But when you live in this conditions for some time, you try to calculate the risk:

- You need to get a proper sleep, to be able to work.
- The air defences are titans, they do their job excellent. Flying fucks are getting shot down regularly.
- In Kyiv, the risk of a direct hit or hit by debris is relatively tolerable: I guess like being hit by a car (the estimate is completely unscientific!)
- If you are unlucky to catch a direct hit ‚Äì you are dead anyway. There's very little chance to survive that.
- If the missile/drone get's shot down nearby, the shockwave are going to blow your windows.

So what do you do? It's up to you, but most of the time I decide to sleep in bed, when things are getting hot, I hide in a bathroom, so when something blows up nearby [I will be behind two walls](https://visitukraine.today/blog/990/list-of-things-to-put-in-an-emergency-suitcase-and-basic-rules-that-will-save-lives-during-missile-strikes) from glass shards and shockwave.

I have a sensor that watches for specific keywords like _"kyiv"_ or a neighbourhood name, for _"warning" **or** "be in a safe place" **or** "fast target"_.

```yaml
multiscrape:
  - name: War Monitor
    resource: https://t.me/s/war_monitor
    scan_interval: 5
    list_separator: '|||'
    binary_sensor:
      - unique_id: danger_in_war_monitor
        name: Danger in War Monitor
        icon: mdi:rocket-launch
        device_class: safety
        select_list: '.js-message_text'
        value_template: >-
          {% set message = value.split("|||") | last | lower %}
          {% set in_kyiv = "–∫–∏—ó–≤" in message or "—Å–≤—è—Ç–æ—à–∏–Ω" in message %}
          {% set danger_now = "—É–≤–∞–∂–Ω–æ" in message
              or "—à–≤–∏–¥–∫—ñ—Å–Ω–∞ —Ü—ñ–ª—å" in message
              or "–ø–æ–¥–∞–ª—ñ –≤—ñ–¥ –∑–æ–≤–Ω—ñ—à–Ω—ñ—Ö —Å—Ç—ñ–Ω" in message
              or "–±–µ–∑–ø–µ—á–Ω–∏—Ö –º—ñ—Å—Ü—è—Ö" in message
          %}
          {{ danger_now and in_kyiv }}
        attributes:
          - name: latest_message
            select_list: '.js-message_text'
            value_template: "{{ value.split('|||') | last }}"
```

When this sensor turns on, it means there's a direct danger to me and I should hide immediately. I send a critical notification, speak a danger message on speakers, so I can quickly wakeup and go to the hideout.

```yaml
alias: 'Alert: Danger in Kyiv'

  hide immediately.
