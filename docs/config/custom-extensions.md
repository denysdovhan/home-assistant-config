# Custom Extensions

Home Assistant has a lot of integrations, but sometimes it's not enough. Fortunately, Home Assistant provides a way to add external integrations.

Below you will find integrations and Lovelace cards [developed by me](#developed-by-me) and [by other smart-home enthusiasts](#third-party).

I use [HACS](//hacs.xyz) for managing my third-party integrations and cards.

## Developed by Me

Sometimes even extensions provided by HACS are not enough, so I had to develop some extensions by myself.

### Lovelace Cards

#### [`vacuum-card`](https://github.com/denysdovhan/vacuum-card)

By default, Home Assistant does not provide any card for controlling vacuum cleaners. This card displays the state and allows you to control your robot.

#### [`purifier-card`](https://github.com/denysdovhan/purifier-card)

As for vacuums, Home Assistant doesn't provide any card for controlling air purifiers either. This card displays the state and allows to control your air purifier.

## Third party

Here's a list of extensions developed by other developers.

### Lovelace Cards

- [`mini-media-player`](https://github.com/kalkih/mini-media-player) — The default one looks not so elegant and has way fewer options to display.
- [`mini-graph-card`](https://github.com/kalkih/mini-graph-card) — This one has a ton of different options. The killer feature for me: the ability to animate and display multiple graphs.
