# Inspiration

On this page, I'm trying to collect useful resources I used to improve my home:

## Configurations

- [MacBury Smart House](https://macbury.github.io/SmartHouse) very cool and complex setup. I was inspired a lot by this.
- [Frenck's Home Assistant Configuration](https://github.com/frenck/home-assistant-config) unusual folder structure.
- [Bas Nijholt's Home Assistant config files](https://github.com/basnijholt/home-assistant-config) autogenerated docs for Home Assistant automations. I borrowed and adjusted a Python script for generating a list of automation from here.

## Articles and Guides
