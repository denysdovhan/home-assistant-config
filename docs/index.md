This is my personal Home Assistant configuration, awakening my home with automations. I hope this will help you inspire to start your home automation journey.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
!!!attention "Beware of changes"
    I constantly improve my home. It evolves as I add new devices and services. It's changing as my daily routines are changing.

    Please, keep in mind **this documentation might be outdated** in covering some details. However, I'll try my best to keep this updated.

The best way to discover new ideas and inspire is by [reading the code][github-url], copying-pasting parts of my configuration and adjusting it to your needs.

Read this documentation to see the bigger picture:

[Hardware](./hardware){: .md-button }
[Home Assistant](./config){: .md-button }
[Inspiration](./resources){: .md-button }

Documentation for the rest of the stuff that I run on my smart home server can be found here:

[Smart Home](https://denysdovhan.com/smart-home){: .md-button }

## What's inside?

My home setup for those who are too lazy to read everything:

- [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) OS run as a virtual machine on [Beelink Mini S12 Pro](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005200158913.html) as a home server.
- [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io) for home automations.
- [Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) and [zigbee2mqtt](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/) for Zigbee devices.
- Reverse proxy using [Nginx Proxy Manager](https://nginxproxymanager.com/) with [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).

## Motivation

I write this documentation for two main reasons:

1. **To keep track of growing my smart home.** To maintain an understanding of how things are working.
2. **To help other enthusiasts inspire.** People often ask about my smart home setup. Now I can give them a link to this documentation, instead of explaining everything once again.

## Limitations

I'm renting my apartment. My landlord handles fixing stuff in my home, covering all the expenses. The only downside is that I can't change anything in my home.

I can't disassemble anything and use custom switches or sockets. It means I can change only easily accessible parts, like bulbs.

## Future Plans

I have a [public Notion board][notion-board] with ideas and tasks for my smart home. You can follow and comment my plans there.
